# 🏏 ODI Cricket Players Analysis  

This project explores **ODI (One Day International) Cricket Players Data** to analyze player participation, performance distribution, and contribution patterns across matches.  

The analysis is performed using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** in a Jupyter Notebook.  

---

## 📊 Project Objectives  
- Explore ODI players’ participation trends.  
- Identify the percentage of players responsible for most ODI appearances (Pareto analysis).  
- Visualize batting and bowling averages.  
- Analyze performance distributions with respect to career span and role.  
- Practice **data cleaning, grouping, and visualization** using Python.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes details of ODI cricket players with columns such as:  
- `Player` → Name of the cricketer.  
- `Country` → Representing nation.  
- `Matches` → Number of ODI matches played.  
- `Innings` → Batting or bowling innings.  
- `Runs` → Total runs scored.  
- `Wickets` → Wickets taken.  
- `Batting Avg` → Batting average.  
- `Bowling Avg` → Bowling average.  
- `Span` → Career span in years.  

*(Columns may vary depending on the dataset used in the notebook)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** → Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization  

---

## 📌 Key Insights  
- A small percentage of players account for **80% of ODI appearances** (Pareto principle).  
- Batting averages show a normal distribution, with top players maintaining consistent high scores.  
- Bowling averages indicate performance variations across countries and eras.  
- Long career spans are usually correlated with consistent performances.  
- Role-based comparison highlights all-rounders’ unique contribution to both batting and bowling.

## 📷 Sample Visualizations  
- Histogram of batting and bowling averages.  
- Pareto analysis of ODI appearances.  
- Country-wise player participation.  
- Correlation heatmap of performance metrics.  
- Scatter plots comparing matches vs batting/bowling averages.
